# RTS-in-unity

Contributors welcome!

This open-source project attempts to create a fully functional Simulated Projectile-style RTS in the Unity Game Engine.

Currently using unity 2019 and soon to be 2020, we aim to have a project that uses new APIs (vulkan), and new technologies (ray-tracing) in order to provide RTS under it's best light and for free.

This project's ambition is to be tampered and will reflect the support that it gathers.
